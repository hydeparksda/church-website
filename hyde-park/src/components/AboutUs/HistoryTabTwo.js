     <p>In 1999, Mattapan teamed up with its mother church, Berea, to erect a big tent in the Dorchester/Roxbury area of Boston to proclaim the gospel message with Pator Conklin Gentry as the evangelist. At the conclusion of these meetings, more than 100 individuals were baptized. A new congregation, Roxbury Mission, was raised up in the Roxbury area of Boston and is now an organized church in the Northeastern Conference.</p>

     <p>Under the leadership of Pastor George Bulgin, on the weekend of December 14-15, 2007, the church relocated from worshiping in the Berea Academy's school auditorium on Norfolk Street in Mattapan, Massachusetts to its  new facilities at 6 Webster Street, Hyde Park, Massachusetts. This will ever be a reminder that we serve a pray-answering, miracle-working God, who sometimes says “no” and “wait,” but in His time blesses beyond our wildest imaginations! The theme for the weekend of celebration was “Forward Together . . . Completing the Mission." The church records put the membership on the day of the church dedication, December 15, 2007, at 304, and the church’s name was changed to Hyde Park Seventh-day Adventist Church. Pastor Bulgin continued to serve as the pastor of the Hyde Park church until 2010.</p>
